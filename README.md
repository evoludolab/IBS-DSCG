# IBS-DSCG

Diversification in spatial continuous games

Individual-based simulations for modelling the effects of population structures on the spontaneous diversification into co-existing high and low investors in social dilemmas, which include the continuous analogues of the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game.

## Build

Run `ant` in this directory to build the jar-archive `build/scanCSD.jar`.

## Run

Change to the `simulations` directory and execute any of the scripts in your favourite shell to run simulations and generate the data for the figures.

**Note:**
* `fig 1.sh` uses the tool `prll` (see https://github.com/exzombie/prll) to manage and run simulations in parallel. 
* some of the simulations require several days to complete.
